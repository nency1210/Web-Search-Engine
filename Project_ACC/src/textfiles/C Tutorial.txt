#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   /* my first program in c */
   printf("hello, world! \n");
   
   return 0;
}
 applications of c programming c was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. c was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. some examples of the use of c are - operating systems language compilers assemblers text editors print spoolers network drivers modern programs databases language interpreters utilities audience this tutorial is designed for software programmers with a need to understand the c programming language starting from scratch. this c tutorial will give you enough understanding on c programming language from where you can take yourself to higher level of expertise. prerequisites before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of computer programming terminologies. a basic understanding of any of the programming languages will help you in understanding the c programming concepts and move fast on the learning track. previous page print page next page advertisements print add notes bookmark this page report error suggestions save close dashboard logout about us refund policy terms of use privacy policy faq's contact ? copyright 2021. all rights reserved.
