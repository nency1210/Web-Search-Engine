informatica is introduced as a software development company in the market. it provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. it launched multiple products that mainly focused on data integration. informatica is used to extracting required data form operation all systems and transforms the same data on its server and load it to the data warehouse. informatica is also introduced as a data integration tool. this tool is based on the etl architecture. it provides data integration software and services for different industries, businesses, government organizations, as well as telecommunication, health care, insurance, and financial services. it has a unique property to connect, process, and fetch the data from a different type of mixed sources. for example, we can connect with more than one server database. here we connect to both oracle and microsoft sql server databases. and it also integrates the data into another system. data extraction the process of reading and extracting the data from multiple source systems into the informatica server is called the data extraction. informatica data can extract or read different methods such as sql server, oracle, and many more. data transformation data transformation is a process of converting the data into the required format. data transformation supports the following activities, such as: data merging: it integrates the data from multiple sources. data cleansing: it cleans the data from unwanted or unnecessary information. data aggregation: it aggregates the data using the aggregate function such as sum(), min(), max(), count(), etc. data scrubbing: it is used to derive the new data. data loading data loading is used to inserting the data into a target system. there are two types of data loading, such as: initial load or full load: it is the first step; it adds or inserts the data into an empty target table. delta load or incremental load or daily load: this step takes place after the initial load, and it is only used to load new records or changed the old records. informatica is an easy to use etl tool, and it has a simple visual primary interface. you drag and drop the different objects and design process flow for data extraction transformation and load. these designed process flow diagrams are called the mappings. informatica has a property to communicate with all major data sources such as rdbms, mainframe, flat files, xml, sap, vsm, and many more. informatica key metrics some main points that reflect the growth in demand for the informatica certification, such as: 2015 income was $1.06 billion, more than the combined income of abinitio, datastage, ssis, and other etl tools. 7-year annual cagr is 30 percent. partners are above 450. major si, isv, oem, and on-demand leaders. customers are above 5,000. customers in 82 countries and a direct presence in 28 countries. number 1 in customer loyalty rankings from 7 years. according to all the above facts, it confirms that informatica is in the huge demand in the world. 9.6.0 is the latest version of informatica powercenter, which is available in the market. below are the following different editions for the powercenter: standard edition advanced edition premium edition the allianz, fannie mae, samsung, ing, and u.s air force are the popular clients using the informatica powercenter as the data integration tool. ibm datastage, oracle owb, microsoft ssis, and ab initio are the competition tool for the informatica. here are some options for the informatica, such as: an organization is migrating from an existing legacy system such as mainframe to a new database system. it can be used as a data cleansing tool. integration of data from various heterogeneous systems. why we need informatica? to perform some operations on the data at the backend in a data system, then we need the informatica. to modify, cleaning up the data based on some set of rules, we need the informatica. by using the informatica, it is accessible to the loading of bulk data from one system to another. it provides a broad set of features such as integration of the data from multiple unstructured, semi-structured or structured systems, operations at row level on data, and scheduling operation of the data operation. it also supports the features of metadata, so it keeps preserved the information of the process and data operations. prerequisite before learning informatica, you must have the basic knowledge of data warehouse and etl based tools. audience our informatica tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals. problem we assure you that you will not find any problem with the informatica tutorial. but if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact form. next topicinformatica architecture next → for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me © copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
