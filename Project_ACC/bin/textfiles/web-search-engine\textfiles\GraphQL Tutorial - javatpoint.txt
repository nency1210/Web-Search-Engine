{
   employee {
      id
      firstname
   }
}
 here, the graphql query fetches values only for the id and firstname fields and not fetch the values for other attributes of the employee object. 
{
   "data": {
      "employee": [
         {
            "id": "101",
            "firstname": "albert"
         },
         {
            "id": "102",
            "firstname": "freda"
         }
      ]
   }
}
 2. retrieve many resources from a single request by using graphql, you can fetch all the data required for your application from a single request while rest apis require loading from multiple urls. that's why applications using graphql are fast even on slow mobile network connections. see this example: we have an object employee. suppose we have another object named company which has the attributes: name and location. the employee object has an association relationship with the company object. if we use rest api to fetch the details of employees and their companies, we have to make two requests to the server like /api/v1/employees and /api/v1/companies. this will force mobile applications to make multiple calls to the server to get the desired data. but if you use graphql, the mobile application can fetch details for both employee and company objects in a single request. see the following graphql query: 
{
   employee{
      id
      firstname
      college{
         name
         location
      }
   }
}
 you can see the output contains exactly those fields you have requested for: 
{
   "data": {
      "employee": [
         {
            "id": "101",
            "firstname": "albert",
            "company": {
               "name": "jtp",
               "location": "paris"
            }
         },
         
         {
            "id": "102",
            "firstname": "freda",
            "company": {
               "name": "hcl",
               "location": "noida"
            }         
         }
      ]
   }
}
 3. graphql queries are simple and human-readable. 4. graphql is best suited for microservices and complex systems because of using a simple query. 5. it facilitates you to deal with many databases efficiently. 6. data can be fetched using a single api call. 7. you don't face over fetching and under fetching issues in graphql. 8. using graphql, you can discover the schema in the appropriate format. 9. graphql provides rich and powerful developer tools for testing queries and documentation. audience to learn graphql, you must have the basic knowledge of . prerequisites our graphql tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals. problem we assure that you will not find any problem in this graphql tutorial. however, if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact form. next topicgraphql installation next → for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me © copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
