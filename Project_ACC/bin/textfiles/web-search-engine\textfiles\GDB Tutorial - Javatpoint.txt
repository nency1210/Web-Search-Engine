gdb -help
 if gdb is already installed, then the above command will show the options which are available with gdb. if this tool is not installed, then we have to install the gdb on our system. we can easily install the gdb on our linux machine using the following two different ways or process: 1. using the pre-built gdb binaries: in this process, we have to run the following two commands on our ubuntu terminal. the following first command is used to update the dependencies: 
sudo apt-get update
 after the successful execution of above command, run the following command which installs the gdb: 
sudo apt-get install gdb
 2. using the compilation process of the downloaded source code in this process, we have to follow the given steps for downloading the gdb: 1. in this step, we have to download the source code by using the http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/ site in the command. 
wget "http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.11.tar.gz
 2. now, we have to extract the downloaded source code: 
tar -xvzf gdb-7.11.tar.gz
 3. after extracting, we have to configure and compile the source code by running the following three commands one by one: 
cd gdb-7.11
gdb-7.11$ ./configure
gdb-7.11$ make
 4. after the completion of the above commands. now, we have to install the gdb using the command which is given below: 
make install
 the above command installs the binaries of a gdb /usr/local/bin and libraries of gdb in /usr/local/lib by default. after the successful execution of the above command, we have successfully compiled and installed the gnu debugger in our linux system. after this, we can easily see the version of gdb by typing the following command and verify that it is successfully installed or not: 
gdb --version
 gdb commands gdb is a command-line tool. so, we have to learn about the commands of gdb before learn about how to use the gdb. gdb provides the various commands, which helps users for debugging the code or programs. the following table shows the list of command with their description: s. no. name of a command description 1. attach this command attaches the gnu debugger with the process which is running. 2. backtrace this command displays the call stack for the thread which is selected currently. 3. backtrace full this command displays the value of local variables. 4. b fun this command sets

how to debug a program using the gnu debugger. now, we have to follow the steps on how to run a program with gdb: step 1: firstly, we have to create a program of c or c++ in the text editor. so, we create the following code for finding a factorial of a number. and, we save this code with the .c extension. 
# include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
      int i, number, j; //declare three variables
      printf ("enter the number: "); 
      scanf ("%d", &number );   // enter the number whose factorial to be calculate
     for (i=number; i>0; i--)  // this loop executes (number-0) times.         
     {
	j=j*i;    
      }
      printf("the factorial of %d is %d\n",number,j);
}
 step 2: now, we have to compile and build the above program.c in terminal with the help of debugging symbols. 
gcc -g program.c
 in the above command, we use the -g option, which is used for compiling the program in debugging mode. step 3: now, we have to run the program with the gdb, so type the following command in the terminal after the above command: 
gdb a.out
 the above command gives the following console of gdb of the current program.

for help, type "help".
type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word"...
reading symbols from a.out...done.
(gdb) 
 in this console, we have to use the gdb commands for analyzing, and debugging the program. step 4: and, at last after debugging, exit the gdb by typing the quit or q command on the prompt of gdb. gdb example in this section, we will learn about how to use the commands of gdb with the example of the c programming language: this example finds the factorial of a given number. in this program, there is an error for the debugging purpose. 
# include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
      int i, number, j; //declare three variables
      printf ("enter the number: "); 
      scanf ("%d", &number );   // enter the number whose factorial to be calculate
     for (i=number; i>0; i--)  // this loop executes (number-0) times.         
     {
	j=j*i;    
      }
      printf("the factorial of %d is %d\n",number,j);
}
 now, check the output of the program by typing the following two commands in the terminal. the first command is for compiling the program: 
gcc program.c
 and, the second command is to run the program: 
./a.out
 after typing the above command, we will see the following output: enter the number: 6
the factorial of 6 is 23592240
 in this output, the factorial of 6 is wrong, so we have to again compile the above program for debugging by using the -g option in the command: 
gcc -g program.c
 now, launch the gdb debugger for debugging the problem by typing the following command. in this command, a.out is a file which is produced after the compilation. the above command gives the following console, which allows us to run the commands of gdb for debugging: now, we use the following steps to debug the above program: step 1: firstly, we have to set a breakpoint in this factorial program by using the following syntax: 
break line number
 after placing the breakpoint in c program, the debugger will stop at it, and gives us a prompt for debugging. so, before executing the program from starting, we have to place the given breakpoint in the program: 
break 10
 this command gives the following statement: 
breakpoint 1 at 0x776: file program.c, line 10.
 step 2: now, we have to execute the c program from starting in gdb debugger by using the following syntax: 
run <args>
 we can easily run the program from starting using the above command. we can also provide the command line arguments to the code by passing the arguments in the above command. but, our program does not need the command line arguments, so we use only run: 
run
 after the typing of the above command, it gives the following prompt for debugging and execute the program until the first breakpoint: 
starting program: /home/sumit/desktop/a.out 
enter the number: 6
 after typing 6, it will give the following prompt: 
breakpoint 2, main () at program.c:10
10			j=j*i; 
 step 3: now, we have to print the values of a variable which are used in this program by using the following syntax: 
print <variable>
 type the following commands for displaying the value of variables of the above program on the console: 
(gdb) print i
$1 = 6    // this is the values of variable i, because in for loop we assign the value of num to variable i.
(gdb) print number
$2 = 6    // this is the value of variable number.
(gdb) print j
$3 = 32767  // this is the value of a variable j. 
(gdb) 
 in the above values, the value of variable j is the garbage, so due to this the output of the factorial program is wrong. therefore, firstly we have to initialize the value of variable j as 1 and execute the above program again. for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me © copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
