know the core concepts of digital electronics. our tutorial covers the basic and academic concepts that include various conversion types, decoders, multiplexers, logic gates, and many more. digital electronics, digital circuits, and digital technology are electronics that are operated on digital signals. digital techniques are much easier for getting the electronic device. these devices are used to switch into one of the known states apart from reproducing a continuous range of values. digital circuits are made from a large collection of logic gates and a simple electronic representation of the boolean logic function. prerequisite digital electronics is the concept of digital computers. a good understanding of the core concepts of computer is required to understand the concept of digital electronics better. audience this tutorial is helpful for those students who are interested in gaining knowledge of how digital circuits are designed and how the computer understand the human language. this tutorial covers all the basics of digital electronics, which helps us to understand circuitry design. problems we assure that you will not find any problem with this digital electronics
