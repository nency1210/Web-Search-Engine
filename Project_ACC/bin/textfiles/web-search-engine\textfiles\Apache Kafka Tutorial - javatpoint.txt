(discussed in later section) consumer api: this api allows an application to subscribe one or more topics and process the stream of records produced to them. streams api: this api allows an application to effectively transform the input streams to the output streams. it permits an application to act as a stream processor which consumes an input stream from one or more topics, and produce an output stream to one or more output topics. connector api: this api executes the reusable producer and consumer apis with the existing data systems or applications. why apache kafka apache kafka is a software platform that has the following reasons which best describes the need of apache kafka. apache kafka is capable of handling millions of data or messages per second. apache kafka works as a mediator between the source system and the target system. thus, the source system (producer) data is sent to the apache kafka, where it decouples the data, and the target system (consumer) consumes the data from kafka. apache kafka is having extremely high performance, i.e., it has really low latency value less than 10ms which proves it as a well-versed software. apache kafka has a resilient architecture which has resolved unusual complications in data sharing. organizations such as netflix, uber, walmart, etc. and over thousands of such firms make use of apache kafka. apache kafka is able to maintain the fault-tolerance. fault-tolerance means that sometimes a consumer successfully consumes the message that was delivered by the producer. but, the consumer fails to process the message back due to backend database failure, or due to presence of a bug in the consumer code. in such a situation, the consumer is unable to consume the message again. consequently, apache kafka has resolved the problem by reprocessing the data. learning kafka is a good source of income. so, those who wish to raise their income in future in it sector can learn. prerequisite the aspirants should have basic knowledge of java programming, and some knowledge of linux commands. audience this apache kafka journey is designed for beginners, developers, and people who wish to learn new things. problems we assure that you will not find any problem in this apache kafkatutorial. but if there is any mistake, please post the problem in a contact form. next topickafka topics next → for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me © copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
