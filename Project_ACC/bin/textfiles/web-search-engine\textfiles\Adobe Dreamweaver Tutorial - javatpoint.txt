feature is very useful. 2. helps beginners to understand the coding for a website. the color-coding feature of highlighting helps beginners very much as it can display what a specific command can do for template and pages. by this, the learning process becomes very easy. 3. code suggestions for the user. it is a very important benefit for beginners while coding. if the user is confused about what to do with an image, a font, or a color, then the adobe dreamweaver will auto-fill the suggestions directly with a drop-down menu in the code. select your choice, which suits your websites and create a code. it is very easy. 4. user needs to switch screens. the real-time results of the program can be seen by the users. many programs do not allow this feature of viewing page in real-time on the same screen. in adobo dreamweaver coding and the designing view is on the same screen, on top is the designing view and on the bottom of the coding area. 5. the code of the developer is instantly checked. for a beginner, it is very important to build a correct and valid in the starting phase. when coding is done in a traditional manner, then accessibility issues and mistakes in the code can occur. adobe dreamweaver highlights the mistakes and shows all the issues and also check all accessibility. 6. using word processing variations in content creation becomes easy. in microsoft office,

via files like someone tabs via internet sites. the functionality included in dreamweaver makes the switching between files makes it very easy. visiting multiple menus using this feature file can be kept ready. this is very beneficial in templates and also in overall design plans. following are the cons of adobe dreamweaver 1. it is not a browser-based ide. the output of the coding in adobe dreamweaver can be different in the browser because the browser will interpret the code in a different way. this becomes a huge disadvantage for the developers because it will not respond in cross-platform. 2. a lot of time is required to learn the interface. when you first start with the adobe dreamweaver, then you will get dozen of items for accessing. depending on the file that you will open, 50+ different things can be seen on the screen. for a beginner, it would be very intimidating to start the coding. 3. what you are seeing is not necessary that you will always get. this is a very disadvantage because here design view proves that it is not a browser-based view. for a developer, it becomes difficult for the positioning of items. it is 100% guaranteed that the output will be very disappointed in the browser. 4. there is no specific automatic coding option. the adobe dreamweaver was designed to meet the requirements of the users. because of this, the code becomes very lengthy. the validation of one line takes 15-20 lines of code in adobe dreamweaver. 5. global styling is a major issue. if a developer wants to use the properties bar on the text within the old version of adobe dreamweaver, then it will add an undefined and not styled document to the coding. in case if you want many dozens of undefined styles, then it will create an issue for styling the website. 6. pressing enter after completion of a line affects the size. generally, when we type a line after completion of it, we press the enter key from the keyboard. in adobe dreamweaver, when you are writing a line, and after completion of it, you press the enter key, then dreamweaver will treat it as a paragraph. also, the text will appear around the image. 7. a lot of additional features by
