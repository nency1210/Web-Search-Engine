of blue prism, blue prism architecture, features of blue prism, and components of blue prism, benefits of using blue prism, installation, etc. blue prism blue prism is a uk based software development company in the field of automation. the company has come up with one of the leading rpa tools, also named blue prism. the blue prism tool is mainly used to develop software robots that help in automating mundane tasks and eliminating manual work. the term rpa, which is an acronym of 'robotic process automation', was first introduced by the blue prism group. blue prism helps business operations to be agile and cost-effective by automating repetitive, rule-based, manual back-office tasks. instead of a manual workforce, blue prism makes use of 'digital workforce', which results in improved accuracy, better security, more compliance, and resilience. the tool is based on java programming language and provides easy to use interface with a visual designer. it allows us to use flow-chart like interface with basic drag and drop functionalities for automating business processes step by step. history of blue prism blue prism was initially introduced in 2001 by a group of some process automation professionals. the primary aim of blue prism was to introduce a technology that could provide the digital workforce and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes. first, blue prism focused on back-office processes as there was an enormous unfulfilled requirement for process automation. the company was co-founded by david moss and alastair bathgate, and they delivered a technology that can perform manual work just like a human. this approach was called rpa or robotic process automation. back in 2003, blue prism came up with its first commercial product called 'automate'. the company kept working on it and increasing the quality of the product. in 2005, the company launched the second version of automate with more advanced features released explicitly for large scale processing. it helped blue prism to achieve the positive impact and trust of customers. therefore, most of the co-operative financial services started using blue prism for automating their business tasks in customer services. due to continuous improvement and following a top-down approach, blue prism helped enterprises automate their business process in an agile and cost-effective manner and reduce the overall human workforce and timelines. why blue prism with its powerful digital workforce and self-learning visual designer interface, blue prism continuously helps users automate billions of processes. the tool has gained an edge over its competitors as it includes better flexibility, security, scalability, compliance, and resilience. apart from that, blue prism has some of the unique features that end customers are getting. these features are helping users to increase productivity, and save hundreds of millions of work hours. blue prism is the only rpa tool which: does not require it skills to implement. does not require any coding skills or programming knowledge. can be implemented in a short duration of time (typically 4 to 8 weeks depending on the complexity of the automation process). is low cost and affordable compared to the other rpa tools in the market. can be implemented within it infrastructure and processes without making changes to the existing environment. creates software robots and supports the digital workforce of enterprise-scale and industrial length. provides tremendous roi that has been as high as 80% and even more. offers excellent payback with self-funding returns. components of blue prism there are a total of four main components present in blue prism, such as: process diagram process studio object studio application modeller process diagram the process diagram is defined as the workflow of business processes, that acts as a program. because blue prism is a java-based rpa tool, these diagrams can make use of core concepts and basics of programming and create the entire operational workflow like flow-chart. these flow charts are nothing but graphical representations of workflows that help analyze, create, modify, or scale the overall business capabilities. the processes in workflows enable us to implement automation in the same way humans would operate them manually. but, these processes are based on the digital workforce and use the logic of software robots. the software robots act in the same way humans would be interacting with the applications and system activities to follow sequences of steps to carry out the required results. process studio the area in blue prism that allows us to create process diagrams is known as the process studio. all the processes are displayed similar to a flowchart. it is one of the main components of blue prism as it contains core features such as variables, business logic, control loops, object calls, etc. these all can be used inside any business flow sequentially and tested flawlessly. the created process flow can be considered as a depiction of a human. apart from that, a process flow can also contain a sequence of steps required to interact with other system applications to achieve the required results. each process flow that we create using process studio contains the main page, which is executed first. object studio one of the basic requirements for enterprises is to interact and communicate with external applications to automate their business processes efficiently. it is impossible to use process studio for this need; therefore, blue prism provides another component called object studio. object studio is the module that enables us to create visual business objects, usually referred to as vbo. these objects are nothing but diagrammatical programs that help in interacting with external business applications. in this component, one business object is responsible for offering an interface that can interact with only one external application. unlike process studio, each object in object studio does not contain main page. besides, it contains two default pages that are organized as a flat group. application modeller application modeller is the embedded capability within the object studio. it is generally used to create application models with object studio. it consists of configuration required to interact with the existing applications and ui elements. these elements are identified by software bots based on specified attributes. the elements are further configured and updated to make them unique for every single element. the software bots can then interact with these elements and perform specified operations over them. blue prism architecture the architecture of rpa blue prism can be classified into the following four elements: process studio object studio control room release manager process studio when it comes to the blue prism architecture, process studio is the most useful element. it enables businesses to create the best process for automation. it helps design, build, test, and modify the automation processes within the blue prism tool. these processes are designed in such a way that they can be reused from the concerned objects. in blue prism, most of the processes are very similar, and they follow the same structure for automation. we can call and process objects at any time as per the project's requirements. the primary function of process studio is to provide sequential processes that are dynamic, reusable, and flexible. to achieve this functionality, the processes are configured with business logic, and results are obtained in the least possible time. process studio has several components that allow us to automate complex business processes efficiently. the libraries of business objects are contrasted as per the project's requirements . the actions and activities are implemented using drag and drop features in a sequential and well-defined structural workflow representation. the actions are inserted with the combination of control loops, business logic, and object calls. these actions are further controlled in the hierarchy situated in the process layer. the actions and activities are defined in sequence and tested in a flow that remains visible to users all the time. object studio object studio is another essential element in the blue prism architecture. it is mainly used when we require objects in blue prism that can be used multiple times. these reusable objects are typically considered as the building blocks for the automation of complex business processes. this approach helps to use existing objects and implement them with current applications as well as external applications. apart from that, there are several default objects available in blue prism that can be directly used to automate various tasks. they can also be modified when required. these default objects are designed to accomplish the automation of basic system tasks. almost all the applications can be easily modeled and further explored to build an array of multiple screens with the help of system elements of object studio. developers can encapsulate all the required interactions directly to the nodes. it is one of the most critical actions followed using object studio in the blue prism automation approach. few other commonly used actions include making changes to the fields, full-scale validation of data, and description of the data, etc. the best thing is that the user can control these actions and recall them multiple times. control room the control room in blue prism architecture is defined as the command center. that means it can be used to control, monitor, schedule, and execute automation processes to the digital workforce. in other words, all the resources in the blue prism architecture are monitored and controlled through control room. the control room is nothing but a centralized administration console inside the blue prism tool that displays insights of the entire process workflow. it allows us to check the startup and the entire working of a process through a manual approach, which means we can select specific information for detailed statistics to ensure proper working. process scheduling in control room makes the execution of certain processes (which are lengthy) easier as these processes can be scheduled for auto-execution when systems are ideal. the control room displays real-time stats and insights of what the software robots are currently doing, at what speed and how effective they are. it also provides run logs that precisely define what actions have been performed by software robots. it will also cover such actions and activities that could not be executed due to any reason. release manager release manager in blue prism architecture is mainly responsible for performing activities whose primary purpose is to release automation processes. it also helps in automating and streamlining the functions related to the management. in simple words, it is used to manage, import, verify, and export configuration packages across various blue prism environments. also, the release manager provides options to create, delete, and modify packages. it contains details of previously created and imported releases of packages. it consists of a tool that can be used to manage the import and export of configuration packages (such as created processes and instructions) between different environments. it offers visibility of packages that were created somewhere else and then imported in blue prism. it provides the ability to manage updates for current as well as newly created processes across the environment. blue prism features the main features of rpa blue
