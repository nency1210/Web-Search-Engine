 why elasticsearch? with large datasets, relational database comparatively works slow and leads to slow search results from the database when queries are executed. rdbms can be optimized but also brings a set of limitations like every field cannot be indexed and updating rows for heavily indexed tables is a long and annoying process. elasticsearch is a nosql distributed database, which is a solution for quick retrieval and storing data. there are some other reasons for using elasticsearch nosql database - elasticsearch allows you to perform and combine various types of searches, like structured as well as unstructured. it also helps in working upon the data, which is based on geography as well as on matrix. you can retrieve the result from the data which you import in anyway you want. it is all based on structured query sets. it allows the users to ask the query anyway they want. elasticsearch provides aggregations that help us to explore trends and patterns in our data. elasticsearch takes care of both query and analysis on data. elasticsearch database helps to complete the search query based on the previous searches automatically. history of elasticsearch elasticsearch was created by shay banon in february 2010. he released the first version 0.4 of elasticsearch, but the company was formed in 2012. the current version of elasticsearch is 7.7, which is released on may 13, 2020. there are various changes has done in elasticsearch, which are discussed below in detail- year description feb 2010 in february 2010, shay banon released the first version of elasticsearch 0.4. 2012 in 2012, elasticsearch company was formed. feb 2015 in february 2014, elasticsearch 1.0 was released. mar 2015 elasticsearch was renamed to elastic on march 2015. oct 2015 another version of elasticsearch 2.0 was released. oct 2016 elasticsearch 5.0 was released in october 2016. jan 2017 elasticsearch 5.2 was released in january 2017. may 2020 the current version of elasticsearch 7.7 is released on may 13, 2020. uses of elasticsearch after knowing that why elasticsearch should be used? let us now discuss the uses of elasticsearch where it can be used - textual search elasticsearch is useful for searching of pure text. it is mainly used where there is a lot of text, but we want to search the data with a specific phrase for the best match. in other words, we search for pure text. product search elasticsearch uses properties and name, which offers faster product searches. geo search elasticsearch is also used for geo-localized any product. for example - a search query like "all institutes that offer pgdm courses in india" can be used to display relevant information of institute by elasticsearch, which offers pgdm courses across india. data aggregation aggregation's framework provides aggregated data based on search queries. it allows to group and performs calculations and statistics on your data using simple search queries. an aggregation can be auto-suggest elasticsearch has an auto-suggest feature, which provides several suggestions to complete an incomplete query. this allows users to type a few characters, and then it will automatically display several suggestions to complete the query. autocomplete based on the previous searches, the elasticsearch database helps to complete the search query automatically. json document storage elasticsearch stores the data in the form of document. the documents are json objects that are stored in elasticsearch index. in other words, the document is considered as a base unit of storage that can be indexed. metrics and analysis it analyses a dashboard that consists of several emails, logs, syslogs, and databases, which helps the businesses to understand their data and provides actionable insights. where can elasticsearch be used? elasticsearch (es) is used as a storage and analysis tool for logs that are generated by disparate systems. it has a schema-less nature. so, it does not require to add a new column for adding a new column to the table. elasticsearch allows adding a new column to incoming data in an index. it accommodates the new columns and makes them available for further operations. elasticsearch allows extracting the metrics from the incoming connection in real-time. therefore, it works well with the time-series analysis of data. prerequisites to learn elasticsearch, the learner should have a basic understanding of java, web technologies, and json. audience nosql database, which is elasticsearch. it is designed for beginners and as well as professionals who want to enhance their skills in different areas. problem we assure you that you will not find any discrepancies or problems in this tutorial. but in case, if you find any mistake, you can inform us by posting it in the contact form. next topicadvantages and disadvantages next → for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me © copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
