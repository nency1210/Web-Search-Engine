import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
info = np.array(['p','a','n','d','a','s'])
a = pd.series(info)
print(a)
 output 0   p
1   a
2   n
3   d
4   a
5   s
dtype: object
 explanation: in this code, firstly, we have imported the pandas and numpy library with the pd and np alias. then, we have taken a variable named "info" that consist of an array of some values. we have called the info variable through a series method and defined it in an "a" variable. the series has printed by calling the print(a) method. python pandas dataframe it is a widely used data structure of pandas and works with a two-dimensional array with labeled axes (rows and columns). dataframe is defined as a standard way to store data and has two different indexes, i.e., row index and column index. it consists of the following properties: the columns can be heterogeneous types like int, bool, and so on. it can be seen as a dictionary of series structure where both the rows and columns are indexed. it is denoted as "columns" in case of columns and "index" in case of rows. create a dataframe using list: we can easily create a dataframe in pandas using list. 
import pandas as pd
# a list of strings
x = ['python', 'pandas']

# calling dataframe constructor on list
df = pd.dataframe(x)
print(df)
 output       0
0   python
1   pandas
 explanation: in this code, we have defined a variable named "x" that consist of string values. the dataframe constructor is being called on a list to print the values. prerequisite before learning python pandas, you should have a basic understanding of computer programming terminologies and any of the programming languages. audience our python pandas tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals. problem we assure that you will not find any problem in this python pandas tutorial. but if there is any mistake, please post the problem in contact form. next topicpython pandas series next → for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me © copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
