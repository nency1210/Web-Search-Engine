class simple{
    public static void main(string args[]){
     system.out.println("hello java");
    }

 test it now application according to sun, 3 billion devices run java. there are many devices where java is currently used. some of them are as follows: desktop applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc. web applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc. enterprise applications such as banking applications. mobile embedded system smart card robotics games, etc. types of java applications there are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using java programming: 1) standalone application standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. these are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. examples of standalone application are media player, antivirus, etc. awt and swing are used in java for creating standalone applications. 2) web application an application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. currently, servlet, jsp, struts, spring, hibernate, jsf, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in java. 3) enterprise application an application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. it has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. in java, ejb is used for creating enterprise applications. 4) mobile application an application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. currently, android and java me are used for creating mobile applications. java platforms / editions there are 4 platforms or editions of java: 1) java se (java standard edition) it is a java programming platform. it includes java programming apis such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. it includes core topics like oops, string, regex, exception, inner classes, multithreading, i/o stream, networking, awt, swing, reflection, collection, etc. 2) java ee (java enterprise edition) it is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. it is built on top of the java se platform. it includes topics like servlet, jsp, web services, ejb, jpa, etc. 3) java me (java micro edition) it is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications. 4) javafx it is used to develop rich internet applications. it uses a lightweight user interface api. prerequisite to learn java, you must have the basic knowledge of c/c++ programming language. audience our java programming tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals. problem we assure that you will not find any problem in this java tutorial. however, if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact form. do you know?
