      entity entity_name is
port (
 port_1_name : mode data_type;
port_2_name : mode data_type;
                  .......
                  port_n_name : mode data_type
                  );
     end entity_name;
 example: 
entiy orgate is
   port (
                a : in   std_logic;
                b : in   std_logic;
                c : out  std_logic
             );
end orgate; 
 using generic if an entity is generic, then it must be declared before the ports. generic does not have a mode, so it can only pass information into the entity. syntax: 
entity entity_name is
    generic (
                  generic_1_name : data_type;
                  generic_2_name : data_type;
                   ........
                  generic_n_name : data_type
                   );
 port (
             port_1_name : mode data_type;
              port_2_name : mode data_type;
              ........
              port_n_name : mode data_type
               );
     end entity_name;
 example: 
  entity logic_gates is
generic (delay : time := 10ns);
port (
       input1 : in std_logic;
       input2 : in std_logic;
       output : out std_logic
       );
end logic_gates;
 rules for writing port name: - port name consist of letters, digits, and underscores. - it always begins with a letter. - port name is case insensitive. modes of port in input port out output port inout bidirectional port buffer buffered output port 2. architecture architecture is the actual description of the design, which is used to describe how the circuit operates. it can contain both concurrent and sequential statements. architecture declaration an architecture can be declared using the following syntax: 
architecture architecture_name of entity_name is
begin
   (concurrent statements )
end architecture_name;
 example: 
architecture synthesis of andgate is
begin
          c <= a and b;
end synthesis;
 3. configuration a configuration defines how the design hierarchy is linked together. it is also used to associate architecture with an entity. configuration declaration 
configuration configuration_name of entity_name is
--configuration declarations
for architecture_name
  for instance_label : component_name
     use entity library_name.entity_name(architecture_name);
end for;
--
end for;
end [configuration] [configuration_name];
 example: 
configuration demo_config of even_detector_testbench is
    for tb_archi
       for uut : even_detector
          use entity work.even_detector (sop_archi);
        end for;
    end for;
end demo_config;
 types of modeling styles in vhdl there are 4 types of modeling styles in vhdl: 1. data flow modeling (design equations) data flow modeling can be described based on the boolean expression. it shows how the data flows from input to output. it works on concurrent execution. 2. behavioral modeling (explains behaviour) behavioral modeling is used to execute statements sequentially. it shows that how the system performs according to the current statement. behavioral modeling may contain process statements, sequential statements, signal assignment statements, and wait statements. 3. structural modeling (connection of sub modules) structural modeling is used to specify the functionality and structure of the circuit. structural modeling contain signal declarations, component instances, and port maps in component instance. vhdl objects vhdl uses the following three types of objects: 1. constants constant is an object which can only hold a single value that cannot be changed during the whole code. example: constant number_of_bytes integer:=8; 2. variables a variable also holds a single value of a given type. the value of the variable may be changed during the simulation by using variable assignment operator. variables are used in the processes and subprograms. variables are assigned by the assignment operator ":=". example: variable index: integer :=0; 3. signals signals can be declared in architecture and used anywhere within the architecture. signals are assigned by the assignment operator "<=". example: signal sig1: std_logic; sig1 <= '1' data types in vhdl data types are the abstract representation of stored data. there are the following data types in vhdl - 1. scalar types integer integer data types are the set of positive and negative whole numbers. floating point floating point data types are the set of positive and negative numbers that contain a decimal point. enumeration enumeration data type is used to increase the readability of the code. physical physical data type describes objects in terms of a base unit, multiples of base unit, and a specified range. 2. composite types arrays arrays are used to hold multiple values of the same types under a single identifier record records are used to specify one or more elements, and each element has a different name and different type. vhdl operators vhdl operators are used for constructing the expressions. there are the following types of operators in vhdl: 1. logical operators logical operators are used to control the program flow. when the logical operators combined with signals or variables, then it is used to create combinational logic. vhdl supports the following logical operators: and or nand nor xor xnor not 2. relational operators in vhdl, relational operators are used to compare two operands of the same data type, and the received result is always of the boolean type. vhdl supports the following relational operators: = equal to /= not equal to < less than > greater than <= less than or equal to >= greater than or equal to 3. arithmetic operators arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations. these operators are numeric types, such as integer and real. vhdl uses the following arithmetic operators: + addition - subtraction * multiplication / division & concatenation mod modulus rem remainder abs absolute value ** exponentiation 4. shift operators in vhdl, shift operator is used to perform the bit manipulation on the data by shifting and rotating the bits of its first operand right or left. vhdl supports the following miscellaneous operators: sll shift logical left srl shift logical right sla shift arithmetic left sra shift arithmetic right rol rotate left ror rotate right note: operators are evaluated in order to their precedence. (i.e., highest to lowest) highest precedence order lowest arithmetic operator shift operator relational operator logical operator the operator of equal precedence is evaluated from left to right. install the xilinx ise tool there are the following steps to install the xilinx ise tool -
