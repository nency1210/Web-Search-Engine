used for client-side scripting, and it is also used for writing server applications and services by using node.js. es6 allows you to write the code in such a way that makes your code more modern and readable. by using es6 features, we write less and do more, so the term 'write less, do more' suits es6. this tutorial introduces you to the implementation of es6 in javascript. what is es6? es6 is an

well-known implementation of ecmascript, comparison to other most famous implementations such as jscript and actionscript. history the ecmascript specification is the standardized specification of scripting language, which is developed by brendan eich (he is an american technologist and the creator of javascript programming language) of netscape (it is a name of brand which is associated with netscape web browser's development). initially, the ecmascript was named mocha, later livescript, and finally, javascript. in december 1995, sun microsystems (an american company that sold the computers and its components, software, and it services. it created java, nfs, zfs, sparc, etc.) and netscape announced the javascript during a press release. during november 1996, netscape announced a meeting of the ecma international standard organization to enhance the standardization of javascript. ecma general assembly adopted the first edition of ecma-262 in june 1997. since then, there are several editions of the language standard have published. the name 'ecmascript' was a settlement between the organizations which included the standardizing of the language, especially netscape and microsoft, whose disputes dominated the primary standard sessions. brendan eich commented that 'ecmascript was always an unwanted trade name which sounds like a skin disease (eczema).' both javascript and jscript aims to be compatible with the ecmascript, and they also provide some of the additional features that are not described in ecma specification. prerequisite before learning es6, you should have a basic understanding of javascript. audience this es6 tutorial is prepared for javascript developers, and it is also useful for those who want to understand the modern developments in the language and apply the same within javascript. problems we assure you that you will not find any problem with this es6 tutorial. but if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact
