the document layout will look the same. pdfs can contain images, text, hyperlinks, video, embedded fonts, forms, interactive buttons, and more. to view the pdf, we just need a pdf reader. there are many applications available that can open pdfs such as adobe acrobat reader, web browsers, and even word processing apps. advantages of pdf following are the advantages of pdf: graphic integrity a pdf displays the same content in the same layout on the different operating systems, software, or device. multi-dimensional a pdf can contain images, text, videos, vector graphics, audio files, hyperlinks, interactive fields, buttons, text boxes, animations, 3d models, etc. we can add these all things into one pdf and organize it as a report or presentation. secure pdf offer options to protect the content of the pdf or a whole pdf document. we can set different levels of access in pdf, such as watermarks, digital signatures, or passwords. convenient pdfs are easy for us to create and read. compact pdfs can store a large amount of information, and they can be compressed. that means we can easily reduce the size of the pdf that is easy to exchange. pdf reader is freeware we can view, read, and print the pdf file with freeware. pdf readers can be downloaded free from the internet on computers and mobile phones. this means we can say we don't need to pay to read the pdf document from any device. e-signing feature pdf is only in the file format that can allow e-signing, which is a process that is as legally binding as hand-writing a signature on a document. disadvantages of pdf following are the disadvantages of pdf: limited os support we can use the pdf only under mac and windows operating systems. linux or unix users can't create or view the pdf files. it is better to use alternative formats such as html or rtf, which supports all platforms. difficult to edit the main goal of pdf was to protect the content and layout of a document with different platforms or apps. that's why pdfs are not easy to edit, and instead of update, recreate the entire document is easy. different types there are two types of pdf files, first is native, and the second is scanned. a native pdf has been converted directly from an electronic file, such as ms word, and a scanned pdf is one that has been created by scanning a physical paper document through a scanner to produce an image of the document. from native pdf, you can copy and paste the text anywhere, but scanned pdfs have limited flexibility. next topiccreate a pdf next → for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me © copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
