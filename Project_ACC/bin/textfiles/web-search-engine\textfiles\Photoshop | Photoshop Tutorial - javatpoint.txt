and manipulate several graphical as well as digital artworks. photoshop is developed by adobe systems and provides support for windows and mac os operating systems. we can create images with layers and save them in a different image format such as jpg, png, gif, tiff, etc. the default file format for photoshop files is psd. the psd stands for photoshop document, which is a native file format for photoshop. it saves the works in actual position as it is in the photoshop workspace. when we open a psd file, it will open the files with layers. photoshop is a premium adobe tool that comes with a 7 days trial period. it is a very popular tool among photographers and graphic designers. it is such popular that the term photo editing is known as photoshop. it provides numerous editing tools and plugins that make it user-friendly and easy to use for editing. features of photoshop over the years, photoshop has become the leading photo editing software from a small editing tool. the beauty of the photoshop tool is its unmatched features. it offers several editing features, which are photoshop exclusive features. none other photo editing software is much capable than photoshop. some key features of the photoshop tool are as follows: layers layers are one of the best features of photoshop. layers allow you to work like a separate piece of paper that you can edit independently and later add to your work. the main advantage of using layers is we can edit a specific component of our image or work without affecting the other components. photoshop provides an easy-to-manage layer palette with some extensive features to manage them, such as opacity (transparency), layer mask, blending modes, lock, etc. we can also manage our layer stack, such as keep a particular layer up and down by just dragging. selection tools photoshop selection tools are very handy to use that designers are additive to work with. photoshop selection tools are improved over the years; nowadays, it provides several advanced selection tools such as marquee tool, magic wand tool, lasso tools, etc., to deal with objects. the magic wand tool is very advanced. it automatically selects similar color pixels and controls the range of colors through tolerance. lasso tools let us manually select the required objects. it provides a hands-free selection process to select the required region of the image. marquee tool allows us to draw different types of selections easily. pen tool the pen tool is a very dominating tool of photoshop. nowadays, we cannot assume photoshop without a pen tool. before the pen tool, the software was nothing but a just editing tool. but, the pen tools make it an advanced designing software. however, the pen tool is not so easy as other tools. it takes time to set the hand on the pen tool, but you can draw anything that you assume once you are familiar with it. it takes the design to the next level. the pen tool's basic task is to draw a path along with anchor points, but the creative stack of this tool is limitless. it provides three types of anchor points to draw and reshape the shapes. shapes it is an essential task for graphic designers to keep the original quality of the object. photoshop's shape layer feature allows us to keep the original quality of the object while manipulating it. however, the shape layer's outlook is limited, but the capabilities of this layer are extremely good. a shape layer can be easily edited using the pen tool or a selection tool and will retain its original quality. slice tool the slice tool is also a fascinating tool of photoshop. it is a useful tool for web designers. we can easily slice any images into different sections to provide an image a web look. retouching tools photoshop provides several retouching tools to provide a new look to the images. it contains few retouching tools such as the stamp tool, pattern stamp tool, spot healing tool, healing tool, patch tool, and many more. every tool has its unique functionality. adobe has developed its retouching tools over the years. smart objects smart objects are also a very useful feature of photoshop. they are a kind of layer that holds image data. the smart object preserves the original data of an image by making it a non-destructive layer. we can embed the content of an image into a new document. also, we can create linked smart objects in reference to another image. the key advantage of a smart object is that we can freely perform the non-destructive transform. adobe creative cloud adobe create cloud provides cloud storage to save your work to the cloud straight from your photoshop. you can easily access your images from any device using the creative cloud. css from layers it is a handy feature for web designers. this feature allows us to generate the css code for specific design elements. for example, if we have drawn a rounded corner rectangle on a layer, if we want the css code for this rectangle, we can do so by right-clicking on that layer and select the copy css option from the context menu. so it makes it easy to create a web template from a photoshop file. photoshop versions photoshop was originally
