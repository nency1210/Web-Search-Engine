linux- kernel is an open-source os and operates on a large scale of working devices having internet connection. the user interface used by chrome os is google chrome, and initially, it was acquired from chromium os, which was also free of cost. the project of the development of chrome os was declared in the year 2009 in july. it was planned to be designed so data from both ends, i.e., user and application, would be stored on the cloud. it means that it would essentially run web applications. the very first device to operate with chrome os as its operating system was the chromebook. chromebook is a netbook that is an inexpensive small laptop with limited functionality and used to access the web. it launched in may 2011 and was mainly shipped by brands like samsung and acer. initially, it only supported chrome apps, but since the year 2004, android applications have also been allowed for the os. it has a consolidated file manager and media player. along with such developments, project crostini was also released as a part of chrome os 69's stable version. after this release, chrome os started supporting linux terminals and applications. chrome os was scripted using different programming languages like c, c++, javascript, html5, python and rust and its kernel type is monolithic. the idea to create chrome os was taken from web centric trend of computing that is being followed since the 1990s. conventional operating systems require a lot of work in terms of time and storage complexity. managing and securing the os, along with keeping it updated and handling its drivers, is a handful of jobs. chrome os remodels this conventional design of the existing operating systems. overall, chrome os is developed over open-source linux- kernal technology combined with google chrome, a media player and file manager. features of chrome os chrome os possesses some unique attributes that are discussed below: easy setup- it is very easy to set up
