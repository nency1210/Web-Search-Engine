This framework is a set of best practices to create and improve the process of ITSM (IT Service Management). It provides a framework within an organization, which helps in planning, measuring, and implementing the services of IT.</p> <p>The main motive of this framework is that the resources are used in such a way so that the customer get the better services and business get the profit.</p> <p>It is not a standard but a collection of best practices guidelines.</p> <p>This framework was introduced by <strong>HMSO (Her Majesty's Stationery Office)</strong> in the U.K in the year of 1989. It was developed based on C.C.T.A. (Central Communication and Telecommunication Agency).</p> <p>Following are the various popular services of IT which are covered by the Information Technology Infrastructure Library <strong>(ITIL)</strong>:</p> 
           <ul class="points">

            <li>It manages the service failure.</li> 
            <li>It helps managers by providing the service which is reliable and useful.</li> 
           </ul> <h2 class="h2">Important Terms used in the ITIL</h2> <p>There are various following terms used in the ITIL which are required to learn:</p> <p><strong>1.

In any organization, the role of a Process Manager is to manage the processes operationally.</p> <p><strong>11. Service Owner:</strong></p> <p>The service owner is a person in an organization, whose role is to deliver the specific service as per the SLA (Service Level Agreement). Also, he is responsible for managing the overall performance, design, and integration of a single service.</p> <p><strong>12. ITSM (IT Service Management):</strong></p> <p>It is a term in the ITIL framework, which provides the services of IT in a focused and client-friendly manner. The main component of ITSM is a framework which design the services according to the SLA. And, that framework is known as SLM (Service Level Management).</p> <p><strong>13. CI (Configuration Item):</strong></p> <p>It is a component having a direct impact on the delivering IT services. The information for each Configuration Item is automatically stored in the configuration record within the CMS (Configuration Management system).</p> <p>This term includes the services of IT, software, hardware, building, and the formal documentation such as SLAs (Service Level Agreement).</p> <p><strong>14. CMDB (Configuration Management Database):</strong></p> <p>This component is used for storing the configuration records, which contains the attributes and the relationships of CI.

Incident:</strong></p> <p>It is a component in ITIL, which is the reduction in the quality of the IT service or an unplanned interruption to the organization's IT services. It is also defined as the failure of a configuration item.</p> <p><strong>24. Service Level Agreement (SLA):</strong></p> <p>In the ITIL framework, there is an SLA agreement in an organization between the customer and the IT service provider. This agreement describes the services of IT and defines the responsibilities of the customer and the provider. Service Level Agreement also describes the document level service targets.</p> <p><strong>25. Operational Level Agreement (OLA):</strong></p> <p>In ITIL, there is also an Operational Level Agreement in an organization of IT between the service provider and other parts of that organization. This term defines the services or goods which are to be provided. And, it also defines the responsibilities of both the parties.</p> <h2 class="h2">Service Lifecycle in ITIL</h2> <p>The ITIL framework is completely based on the lifecycle of a service. The lifecycle of IT Service Management is also called as a 'Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)' or 'Deming Cycle'. It helps the service providers to achieve a better understanding of its structure. It also defines the process that how the services are started and maintained.</p> <p>The lifecycle of a service in the framework of ITIL is broadly classified into the following five stages:</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/itil/images/service-lifecycle-in-itil.png" alt="ITIL Tutorial"> 
           <ol class="points"> 
            <li>Service Strategy</li> 
            <li>Service Design</li> 
            <li>Service Transition</li> 
            <li>Service Operations</li> 
            <li>Continual Service Improvement</li> 
           </ol> <p>Each stage in this lifecycle contains the various process of ITIL and all the stages are interconnected. Now, we will learn about each stage of service lifecycle one by one.</p> <h3 class="h3">Service Strategy</h3> <p><strong>Service Strategy</strong> is the first and initial stage in the lifecycle of the ITIL framework. The main aim of this stage is that it offers a strategy on the basis of the current market scenario and business perspective for the services of IT.</p> <p>This stage mainly defines the plans, position, patters, and perspective which are required for a service provider. It establishes the principles and policies which guide the whole lifecycle of IT service.</p> <p>Following are the various essential services or processes which comes under the <strong>Service Strategy</strong> stage:</p> 
           <ul class="points"> 
            <li>Financial Management</li> 
            <li>Demand Management</li> 
            <li>Service Portfolio Management</li> 
            <li>Business Relationship Management</li> 
            <li>Strategy Management</li> 
           </ul> <p><strong>Strategy Management:</strong></p> <p>The aim of this management process is to define the offerings, rivals, and capabilities of a service provider to develop a strategy to serve customers.</p> <p>According to the version 3 (V3) of ITIL, this process includes the following activities for IT services:</p> 
           <ol class="points"> 
            <li>Identification of Opportunities</li> 
            <li>Identification of Constraints</li> 
            <li>Organizational Positioning</li> 
            <li>Planning</li> 
            <li>Execution</li> 
           </ol> <p>Following are the three sub-processes which comes under this management process:</p> 
           <ol class="points"> 
            <li>Strategic Service Assessment</li> 
            <li>Service Strategy Definition</li> 
            <li>Service Strategy Execution</li>
